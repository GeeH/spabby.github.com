            <h1>Is Composer the Path to the Promised Land?</h1>

                It started with a tweet:
            </p>

            <blockquote class="twitter-tweet"><p>Building a PHP app by gluing things together using Composer is turning

            </p>

            <p>
                And that intrigued me. Does Composer's wide adoption in the PHP community at large mark the start of a
                shift from full stack frameworks (like Symfony and Zend Framework), towards people contributing to open
                source "modules" that do one thing, but do it really really well?
            </p>

            <p>
                Let's say your starting a new project, and you don't want to use a full stack framework (in the current
                climate you'd be called mad, but bare with me here a minute...). You've got some favourite components
                that you currently use in other projects.
            </p>

            <p>
                For dependency management, you want to use <a href="http://pimple.sensiolabs.org/" target="_blank">Pimple</a>,
                you'd like your logging handled by <a href="https://github.com/Seldaek/monolog"
                                                      target="_blank">Monolog</a>.
                For your DBAL/ORM you're a big fan of <a href="http://www.doctrine-project.org/" target="_blank">Doctrine</a>,
                and for your view layer you've always wanted to try <a href="http://mustache.github.io/">Mustache</a>.
            </p>

            <p>
                Go to it. Add these projects as Composer dependencies, and you only need to create a simple routing
                system,
                a rudimentary MVC and away you go, you're concentrating your time on your core business logic in just as
                little time as using a full stack framework but without the concessions you inevitably make when
                choosing
                one. Let's be honest, a rudimentary MVC is only a way of translating the requested URL to a predictable
                class/method.
            </p>

            <p>
                For me, this is even more attractive than adopting, say, Zend Framework 2, because _you've_ written your
                core code, and therefore _you_ understand exactly how and why your routing and MVC work. I'm sure
                someone
                will quickly tell me "why not just use x micro-framework? It handles routing and MVC only leaving you
                to fill in the gaps!", and I'm sure that is a viable alternative, but maybe that defies the point I'm
                trying
                to make. Many times in my ZF based career I've found myself deep in the MVC to understand how and why a
                certain behaviour is happening (or even better, badgering the person who wrote it in IRC).
            </p>

            <p>
                Of course, using a cocktail of great OS projects from the web will still give you this problem in the
                individual components you are using. But for me, understanding how it all hangs together is a massive
                plus in the rapid development and maintenance of a project of average complexity.
            </p>

            <p>
                Those who know me will know I am a definite evangelist of Zend Framework 2; it's what I use to earn my
                daily bread. I'm not advocating stopping using ZF2 just yet, but what I am wondering is will the PHP
                ecosystem be a healthier place if we have groups of kick-ass developers solving one problem really well,
                rather than trying to spread themselves thinly writing and maintaining a full stack. After all, there
                are
                only a finite number of contributors to even the most popular OS project.
            </p>

            <p>
                In all honesty, people will probably think I'm crazy for asking these questions, but for me, this is a
                very interesting time to be involved in the community. I don't think Zend of Symfony will be turing off
                their framework GitHub repos just yet, but it will definitely be interesting to see what the future
                holds!
